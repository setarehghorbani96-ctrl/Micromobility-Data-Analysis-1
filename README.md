Micromobility and Urban Transport Analysis

Politecnico di Torino – MSc Digital Skills for Sustainable Societal Transitions
Course: Transport Innovation for a Sustainable, Inclusive and Smart Mobility

-Project Overview

This project explores micromobility data (bikes, scooters, and shared vehicles) to analyze how sustainable mobility solutions are being adopted in Austin (Texas) and Chicago (Illinois).
Using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and GIS tools (QGIS/ArcGIS), the analysis investigates spatial, temporal, and behavioral mobility patterns to support data-driven urban planning.

-Objectives

Clean and process large-scale mobility datasets

Identify trends in micromobility usage across time and space

Build and visualize Origin–Destination matrices between districts

Analyze peak-hour travel behavior and seasonal variations

Study the relationship between micromobility and public transport networks

Conduct a business model and profitability analysis of shared mobility systems

Evaluate generalized transport costs for multiple modes (car, bike, scooter, bus, taxi)

-Skills and Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization

GIS (QGIS, ArcGIS) – Spatial mapping of urban transport networks

Excel – Cost and Value of Time calculations

Data Analytics & Urban Mobility Modeling – Interpreting results for policy and sustainability

-Key Insights

Austin: Districts 9 and 3 showed the highest micromobility activity, highlighting local transport hubs.

Chicago: Micromobility strongly complements metro and bus lines, enhancing last-mile connectivity.

Seasonal trends: Usage peaks in autumn and declines in winter months.

Business model: Demonstrated financial viability with strong revenue surplus in shared mobility systems.

Cost analysis: Private e-scooter and public transport proved the most efficient commuting modes.
